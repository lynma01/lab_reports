# Objective

The objective of this experiment is to demonstrate how ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) and/or a lateral flow assay can be used to analyze the presence of melamine/immune-response proteins in a sample. Specifically, this experiment will use these different immunological assays to simulate the detection of metabolic/food allergens.
