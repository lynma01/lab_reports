# Objective

The objective of this experiment is to demonstrate how ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) and/or a lateral flow assay can be used to analyze the presence of melamine/immune-response proteins in a sample. Specifically, this experiment will use these different immunological assays to simulate the detection of metabolic/food allergens.

# Results

- Standard Curves were generated from Synergy Neo2 photospectometer data. Both the kit's calibrating samples, and the unknown samples were filtered, selected, and plotted in @fig-sc-chart on the left and right-hand sides respectively.

- Given the logarithmic nature of the above plotted data, a logarithmic trendline was used as the equation from which to estimate the unknown samples' protein concentration in ng/ml. The $R^2$ of the equation was 0.9058, which provides some confidence in estimation's fit to the curve.


### Estimating Protein Concentration {#sec-r-e-epc}

- Using the Sample's Dilution Value of 3.0 from @fig-sc-chart, we can examine the estimate of the protein concentration in ng/ml for that value. We see that in order of most protein concentration to least is sample 3, sample 1, and sample 2.

- While there is an exception for sample 1's final value at 10.0 dilution factor, the majority of the dilution curve is aligned with the standard curve of known samples on the left-hand side. This verifies the majority of the samples behavior aligns with the expected values.

## Lateral Flow Assay {#sec-r-lf}

- While faint banding in the "T" line is present for both sample "H", and "-", only the milk sample ("M") contains the distinct banding required to confirm the absence of the melamine in the sample. This is an unexpected result for two reasons: 1) because the "-" sample is presumed to be acting as a negative control, ensuring the validity of the LFA tests kits depicted, and 2) because milk has been reported to have an increasing concentration of melamine as an economical method of improving the listed protein content in retail stores.[^mt_5]

- From the lateral flow assay, we can conclude that samples "A", and "+" contained melamine. This is encouraging in that the "+" sample is included as a positive control within the experiment. This allows a measure of confidence while making conclusions in @sec-i-e.

# Interpretation & Discussion

## ELISA Experiment {#sec-i-e}

The ELISA experiment's results for all three unknown samples plotted curves which predominantly aligned with the standard curve of known protein concentrations from the test kit. This implies that the data collection process did not contain breaches in protocol which unduly undermine our confidence in the results.

Using the standard curve, we pick pick the pick where the relative dilution fraction is 0.75 to plot the calculated concentration in ng/ml. From that point, we can see that the estimated concentration of the three samples is ~6.1, ~2.2, and ~5.9 ng/ml. However, given the anomalous readings for sample 1 at the dilution, further experimentation would be necessary to verify that the readings were merely human error during the dilution stage of the process.

In all three samples, we're thus able to confirm the presence and estimated concentration of the immunological protein within the samples using both the standard curve derived from the test kit, as well as the dilution curve generated from the sample data.

## Lateral Flow Assay {#sec-i-lf}

The Lateral Flow assay depicted in @fig-r-lfa confirmed the presence of Melamine within "H", "A", and "+" samples. However, the indistinct banding within the "-" sample (presumed to be acting as an experimental control) complicates the interpretation of the results. Without a distinct band in the "-" sample, we cannot confidently confirm the specificity/sensitivity of the Lateral Flow test kits used in the experiment. 

Further experimentation would be necessary to confidently conclude the presence of melamine in the samples. The additional experiment would have to use multiple Lateral Flow assays to compare and contrast results between the different samples, thus examining the performance of the assays themselves when detecting the presence of melamine. 

Once the Lateral Flow Assays are able to determine the presence/absence of melamine within the calibration samples "+"/"-", we would then be able to make a confident conclusion as to whether the other samples "A", "H", "M", truly did contain melamine or not.
