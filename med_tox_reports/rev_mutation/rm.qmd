# Objective

The objective of this experiment is to demonstrate the Ames Assay's ability to detect the mutagenic potential of chemicals and compounds. Specifically, we will attempt to detect mutations caused by exposure of bacteria to an S9 fraction, reverting them to their wild-type phenotype and enabling them to grow in the absence of histidine.

# Results {#sec-results}

## B Plates without S9 Fraction

- Condensation on the microarray cover is present for both samples from the incubation period described in the protocol.

- The purple coloring is consistent across all 96 wells, suggesting that the bacteria within the wells did not mutate despite the presence of the suspected mutagen B.

- Markings on the side of the B plate demonstrate that it did *not* contain the metabolism enhancing S9 fraction which would have increased the uptake of the suspected mutagenic substance into the bacterial cells.[^mt_3]

## SvB plates with S9 Fraction

- The yellow coloring is present across all 96 wells in the microarray, suggesting that the reverse mutation of the bacteria was successful across all wells.

![Side-view of the SvB plate demonstrating that it does contain the metabolism activating S9 fraction which would theoretically cause the mutations to manifest.](images/mutation_p2_side.JPG){width=4in #fig-r-s9-side}

- Markings on the side of the SvB plate demonstrate that it contains both the suspected mutagen, SvB, and the metabolism enhancing S9 fraction which would theoretically increase the rate which mutations manifest.

# Interpretation & Discussion

::: {.callout-note}
An important note in this experiment is the author mistakenly added two different mutagens into the sample plates instead of keeping the samples consistent between the plates. Within @fig-r-b, and @fig-r-s9, instead of Mutagen B and SvB, the mutagens should have been consistent across the fractions: either both plates containing mutagen B or mutagen SvB to properly compare the effect of the S9 metabolic activator.
:::

The Ames test uses bacteria with a mutation in the histidine biosynthesis pathway, making them dependent on histidine for growth. Exposure to a mutagen can cause a reversion back to the wild type, allowing them to grow without histidine. 

In the Ames Test, the reverse mutation of the bacteria back to its wild type will evince a yellow color, while lack of reverse mutation is evinced by a purple color. The coloration of Plate 1 in @fig-r-b suggest that the tested compound is not mutagenic in its original form, while @fig-r-s9 becomes mutagenic after metabolic activation by the S9 fraction. 

However, because of the breach of experimental protocol where neither mutagen was completely compared with and without the S9 fraction, we cannot conclude if mutagen B is mutagenic in humans without the S9 fraction, and we cannot conclude if the SvB mutagen is mutagenic in humans without an experimental control to verify our results. Finally, while a positive Ames test indicates the mutagenic potential of a compound and may act as a carcinogen, further testing is required to confirm carcinogenicity.
