# Interpretation & Discussion

## Summary of Results
The results suggest that the tested compound is **not mutagenic in its original form** but **becomes mutagenic after metabolic activation by the S9 fraction**. In the Muta-ChromPlate test, a colorimetric substrate is used. If the bacteria revert to wild type, the substrate turns yellow. If not, it remains purple.

The Ames test uses bacteria with a mutation in the histidine biosynthesis pathway, making them dependent on histidine for growth. Exposure to a mutagen can cause a reversion back to the wild type, allowing them to grow without histidine. 

## Examining observations outlined from @sec-results

- **Completely Purple Plate (without S9):** This indicates that the bacteria in this plate did not revert to the wild type, suggesting that the compound in its original form is not mutagenic to the bacteria.
  
- **Completely Yellow Plate (with S9):**  This indicates that the bacteria in this plate reverted to the wild type. The addition of the S9 fraction, which simulates mammalian metabolism, likely activated the compound into a mutagen, leading to the observed mutations in the bacteria.

**In summary:** The experiment demonstrates that the tested compound requires metabolic activation to become mutagenic. This highlights the importance of including the S9 fraction in the Ames test, as it allows for the detection of mutagens that may not be active in their original form.

**Additional Considerations:**

- **Specificity of the Test Strains:** Different strains of bacteria used in the Ames test are sensitive to different types of mutations (frameshift or base-pair substitution). Knowing the specific strain used in your experiment can provide insights into the type of mutation induced by the compound after S9 activation. 

- **Statistical Significance:** The number of positive wells in the experimental plates should be compared to the spontaneous mutation rate observed in the "Background" plates (without any test compound). This comparison helps determine if the observed mutagenicity is statistically significant.

While a positive Ames test indicates the mutagenic potential of a compound and may act as a carcinogen, further testing is required to confirm carcinogenicity.
