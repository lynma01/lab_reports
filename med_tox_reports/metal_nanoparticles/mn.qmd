# Objective

The objective of this experiment is to assess if nanoparticle-toxicity impacts different cellular and organismal systems. The organisms being examined in the experiment are specifically, *C. elegans* and germinating Mung Bean seedlings.

# Results

## Effects of Nanoparticles on *C. elegans*

*C. elegans* were exposed to several suspected toxic substances, and their thrashes were recorded during 30 second intervals with intervening 2 minute break periods for a total of five minutes total observation for each substance.

The collected data is rendered in the following chart:

```{python}
import polars as pl
import altair as alt

alt.renderers.enable("svg")

ce=pl.read_csv("data/c_elgans.csv")

# make the chart
alt.Chart(ce, height=60,width=480).mark_bar().encode(
    alt.Y("sample_num:N").title("Sample #"),
    alt.X("thrashes:Q").title("C. Elegans Observed Thrashes"),
    alt.Row('substance:N').title("Suspected Toxic Substance"),
    color=alt.Color('thrashes:Q').scale(scheme="yellowgreenblue")
)
```

- TiO2 had a greater number of observed thrashes than pbs/control sample.

- Samples #1, #3 for both Ag and AlO2 were greater than pbs/control for those same sample observations.

- *C. elegans* exposed to bleach were paralyzed, and recorded 0 thrashes for all three samples.

## Assessing Nanoparticles effects on Mung Beans {#sec-r-mb}

### Chart analyzing impact of nanoparticles on plant germination {#sec-r-mb-chart}
```{python}
pl=pl.read_csv("data/mb_plant_data.csv")

alt.Chart(pl, height=60,width=480).mark_circle(size=80).encode(
    alt.Y("weight_g:Q").title("Weight (g)"),
    alt.X("root_length_cm:Q").title("Root Length (cm)"),
    alt.Row('substance:N').title("Suspected Toxic Substance"),
    color=alt.Color('sample:N').scale(scheme="yellowgreenblue"),
    tooltip="sample"
)
```

### Examination of Germinating Plant Samples {#sec-r-mb-pics}

Each of the petri dishes below contained 10 Mung Bean samples which were coated in the same nanoparticles as the *C. elegans* experiment above. The root length, and sample weight were recorded for use in the analytical section for visualization (see section @sec-r-mb-chart).
