	abstract = {While language model ({LM})-powered chatbots and generative search engines excel at answering concrete queries, discovering information in the terrain of unknown unknowns remains challenging for users. To emulate the common educational scenario where children/students learn by listening to and participating in conversations of their parents/teachers, we create Collaborative {STORM} (Co-{STORM}). Unlike {QA} systems that require users to ask all the questions, Co-{STORM} lets users observe and occasionally steer the discourse among several {LM} agents. The agents ask questions on the user's behalf, allowing the user to discover unknown unknowns serendipitously. To facilitate user interaction, Co-{STORM} assists users in tracking the discourse by organizing the uncovered information into a dynamic mind map, ultimately generating a comprehensive report as takeaways. For automatic evaluation, we construct the {WildSeek} dataset by collecting real information-seeking records with user goals. Co-{STORM} outperforms baseline methods on both discourse trace and report quality. In a further human evaluation, 70\% of participants prefer Co-{STORM} over a search engine, and 78\% favor it over a {RAG} chatbot.},

This underexplored problem poses new challenges at the pre-writing stage, including how to research the topic and prepare an outline prior to writing. We propose {STORM}, a writing system for the Synthesis of Topic Outlines through Retrieval and Multi-perspective Question Asking. {STORM} models the pre-writing stage by (1) discovering diverse perspectives in researching the given topic, (2) simulating conversations where writers carrying different perspectives pose questions to a topic expert grounded on trusted Internet sources, (3) curating the collected information to create an outline. For evaluation, we curate {FreshWiki}, a dataset of recent high-quality Wikipedia articles, and formulate outline assessments to evaluate the pre-writing stage. We further gather feedback from experienced Wikipedia editors. Compared to articles generated by an outline-driven retrieval-augmented baseline, more of {STORM}'s articles are deemed to be organized (by a 25\% absolute increase) and broad in coverage (by 10\%). The expert feedback also helps identify new challenges for generating grounded long articles, such as source bias transfer and over-association of unrelated facts.},

              et al
              . present Evo, a multimodal artificial intelligence model that can interpret and generate genomic sequences at a vast scale. The Evo architecture leverages deep learning techniques, enabling it to process long sequences efficiently. By analyzing millions of microbial genomes, Evo has developed a comprehensive understanding of life’s complex genetic code, from individual {DNA} bases to entire genomes. This enables the model to predict how small {DNA} changes affect an organism’s fitness, generate realistic genome-length sequences, and design new biological systems, including laboratory validation of synthetic {CRISPR} systems and {IS}200/{IS}605 transposons. Evo represents a major advancement in our capacity to comprehend and engineer biology across multiple modalities and multiple scales of complexity (see the Perspective by Theodoris). —Di Jiang

              {INTRODUCTION}
              The fundamental instructions of life are encoded in the {DNA} sequences of all living organisms. Understanding these instructions could unlock deeper insights into biological processes and enable new ways to reprogram biology into useful technologies. However, even the simplest microbial genomes are incredibly complex, with millions of {DNA} base pairs encoding the interplay of {DNA}, {RNA}, and proteins—the three modalities of the so-called central dogma of molecular biology and the key actors in cellular function. This complexity exists at multiple scales, from individual molecules to whole genomes, representing a vast landscape of genetic information that has been functionally selected over evolutionary time.
            
            
              {RATIONALE}
              Rapid progress in artificial intelligence ({AI}) has led to large language models that demonstrate increasingly advanced multitask reasoning and generation capabilities when trained on massive amounts of data. However, technological limitations in the architecture of these models have restricted efforts to apply them to biology at a similar scale. Current approaches struggle to analyze sequences at the individual character level and are computationally demanding when applied to long sequences. An advanced model maintaining single-nucleotide resolution over large genomic sequences could potentially extract functional information about the complex molecular interactions that are embedded in the patterns of natural evolutionary variation.
            
            
              {RESULTS}
              In this work, we present Evo, a genomic foundation model that enables prediction and generation tasks from the molecular to the genome scale. Using an architecture based on advances in deep signal processing, we scaled Evo to 7 billion parameters with a context length of 131 kilobases at single-nucleotide resolution. We report scaling laws on {DNA}, complementing similar observations in natural language and vision. Trained on 2.7 million prokaryotic and phage genomes, Evo demonstrates zero-shot function prediction across {DNA}, {RNA}, and protein modalities that is competitive with—or outperforms—domain-specific language models. Evo also excels at multimodal generation tasks, which we demonstrated by generating synthetic {CRISPR}-Cas molecular complexes and transposable systems. We experimentally validated the functional activity of Evo-generated {CRISPR}-Cas molecular complexes as well as {IS}200 and {IS}605 transposable systems, representing the first examples of protein-{RNA} and protein-{DNA} codesign with a language model. Using information learned over whole genomes, Evo learns how small changes in nucleotide sequence affect whole-organism fitness and can generate {DNA} sequences with plausible genomic architecture more than 1 megabase in length.
            
            
              {CONCLUSION}
              Evo is a foundation model that is designed to capture two fundamental aspects of biology: the multimodality of the central dogma and the multiscale nature of evolution. The central dogma integrates {DNA}, {RNA}, and proteins with a unified code and predictable information flow, whereas evolution unifies the vastly different length scales of biological function represented by molecules, pathways, cells, and organisms. Evo learns both of these representations from the whole-genome sequences of millions of organisms to enable prediction and design tasks from the molecular to genome scale. Further development of large-scale biological sequence models like Evo, combined with advances in {DNA} synthesis and genome engineering, will accelerate our ability to engineer life.
              
                
                  Evo, a 7-billion-parameter genomic foundation model, learns biological complexity from individual nucleotides to whole genomes.
                  Trained on 2.7 million raw prokaryotic and phage genome sequences, Evo is naturally multimodal, enabling the codesign of {DNA}, {RNA}, and protein molecules that form higher-order functional systems. Evo is also inherently multiscale, enabling prediction and generation tasks at the level of molecules, systems, and genomes.},

Results show further that among the operator-based instruments, the {NASA} {TLX} is the most reliable and valid questionnaire to measure workload and that {NASA} {TLX} can be used in a healthcare setting. Managers of hospitals and {ICUs} can benefit from the results of this research as it provides benchmark data on workload experienced by nurses in a variety of {ICUs}.},

However, acceptability of workload is difficult to interpret based on the scores, and the measure is time consuming for use in test scenario breaks. This paper reports the identification and evaluation of a one-item subjective rating for the acceptability of mental workload. Study 1 found that one item, mental demand, highly represented the multidimensional {TLX} and that operators rated this item to be distinct from performance and situation awareness. Study 2 investigated the acceptance scale’s sensitivity to control room modification, and the study found that operators’ rating of level of mental demand and rating of acceptability of mental demand were moderately related. The rating of acceptability, compared with the original scale, was more sensitive to control room modernisation and was more strongly related to subjective performance. Operators’ rating of acceptable workload was significantly related to observers’ assessment of team performance, while the rating of level was not. Both acceptable and non-acceptable workload were related to high levels of the original {TLX} scales, indicating that operators’ perception of acceptable workload was not fixated on a particular level of the original {TLX} scale. The results supported that efficient assessment can be achieved by applying only the {TLX} mental demand item and by supplementing or replacing the original rating scale with an acceptability rating scale. The approach presented applies to establishing ‘redlines’ for human performance constructs beyond mental workload.},

This study leverages the Microsoft Academic Graph, a massive bibliographic dataset with detailed subfield information, to investigate {AI} adoption patterns among researchers in various disciplines (18 non-{AI} disciplines ranging from the humanities and social sciences to {STEM}), career stages (early, mid, and senior), and the interactions between these two aspects from 2006 onwards. Our findings indicate that researchers in economics and business can play an important bridging role in {AI}-related collaborations between {STEM} and social science researchers, who currently exhibit substantial disparities in {AI} adoption patterns. Late early-career to early mid-career researchers tend to adopt {AI} more actively than others, although this pattern varies across disciplines.

	shorttitle = {Generative {AI} and the future of education},
	abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence ({AI}) has taken the world by storm, with notable tension transpiring in the field of education. Given that Generative {AI} is rapidly emerging as a transformative innovation, this article endeavors to offer a seminal rejoinder that aims to (i) reconcile the great debate on Generative {AI} in order to (ii) lay the foundation for Generative {AI} to co-exist as a transformative resource in the future of education. Using critical analysis as a method and paradox theory as a theoretical lens (i.e., the “how”), this article (i) defines Generative {AI} and transformative education (i.e., the “ideas”), (ii) establishes the paradoxes of Generative {AI} (i.e., the “what”), and (iii) provides implications for the future of education from the perspective of management educators (i.e., the “so what”). Noteworthily, the paradoxes of Generative {AI} are four-fold: (Paradox \#1) Generative {AI} is a ‘friend’ yet a ‘foe’, (Paradox \#2) Generative {AI} is ‘capable’ yet ‘dependent’, (Paradox \#3) Generative {AI} is ‘accessible’ yet ‘restrictive’, and (Paradox \#4) Generative {AI} gets even ‘popular’ when ‘banned’ (i.e., the “what”). Through a position that seeks to embrace rather than reject Generative {AI}, the lessons and implications that emerge from the discussion herein represent a seminal contribution from management educators on this trending topic and should be useful for approaching Generative {AI} as a game-changer for education reformation in management and the field of education at large, and by extension, mitigating a situation where Generative {AI} develops into a Ragnaro¨k that dooms the future of education of which management education is a part of (i.e., the “so what”).},

	abstract = {Academic careers in Germany have been under debate for a while. We conduct a survey among postdocs in Germany to analyze the perceptions and attitudes of postdocs regarding their research incentives, their working conditions, and their career prospects. We conceptualize the career prospects of a postdoc in a life-cycle perspective of transitions from academic training to academic or non-academic jobs. Only about half of the postdocs sees strong incentives for academic research, but there is quite a strong confidence to succeed in an academic career. Furthermore, postdocs who attended a {PhD} program show better career prospects and higher research incentives compared to others. Academic career prospects and motivation are strongest for assistant professors. Apart from this small group, however, postdocs report only a small impact of the university reforms of the last decade. Female postdocs show significantly higher research incentives but otherwise we find little gender differences. Finally, good prospects in nonacademic jobs are not associated with a reduction in the motivation for research.},

  abstract     = {Much of the literature examining the impact of the Bayh-Dole Act has been based on the impact on patenting and licensing activities emanating from ofﬁces of technology transfer. Studies based on data generated by ofﬁces of technology transfer, suggest a paucity of entrepreneurial activity from university scientists in the form on new startups. There are, however, compelling reasons to suspect that the {TTO} generated data may not measure all, or even most of scientist entrepreneurship. Rather than relying on measures of scientist entrepreneurship reported by the {TTO} and compiled by {AUTM}, this study instead develops alternative measures based on the commercialization activities reported by scientists. In particular, the purpose of this paper is to provide a measure of scientist entrepreneurship and identify which factors are conducive to scientist entrepreneurship and which factors inhibit scientist entrepreneurship. This enables us to compare how scientist entrepreneurship differs from that which has been established in the literature for the more general population. We do this by developing a new database measuring the propensity of scientists funded by grants from the National Cancer Institute ({NCI}) to commercialize their research as well as the mode of commercialization. We then subject this new university scientist-based data set to empirical scrutiny to ascertain which factors inﬂuence both the propensity for scientists to become an entrepreneur. The results suggest that scientist entrepreneurship may be considerably more robust than has generally been indicated in studies based on {TTO} data.},

In this paper, entrepreneurship is identified as one such mechanism facilitating the spillover of knowledge. Using a panel of entrepreneurship data from 18 countries, we provide empirical evidence that, in addition to measures of Research \& Development and human capital, entrepreneurial activity also serves to promote economic growth.},
