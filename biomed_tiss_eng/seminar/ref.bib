	abstract = {Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ({NASH}), an advanced stage of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ({NAFLD}), is a rapidly growing and global health problem compounded by the current absence of specific treatments. A major limiting factor in the development of new {NASH} therapies is the absence of models that capture the unique cellular structure of the liver microenvironment and recapitulate the complexities of {NAFLD} progression to {NASH}. Organ-on-a-chip platforms have emerged as a powerful approach to dynamically model diseases and test drugs. Herein, we describe a {NASH}-on-a-chip platform. Four main types of human primary liver cells (hepatocytes [{HCs}], Kupffer cells, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, and hepatic stellate cells [{HSCs}]) were cocultured under microfluidic dynamics. Our chip-based model successfully recapitulated a functional liver cellular microenvironment with stable albumin and urea secretion for at least 2 weeks. Exposing liver chips to a lipotoxic environment led to gradual development of {NASH} phenotypic characteristics, including intracellular lipid accumulation, hepatocellular ballooning, {HSC} activation, and elevation of inflammatory and profibrotic markers. Further, exposure of the chip to elafibranor, a drug under study for the therapy of {NASH}, inhibited the development of {NASH}-specific hallmarks, causing an {\textasciitilde}8-fold decrease in intracellular lipids, a 3-fold reduction in number of ballooned {HCs}, a significant reduction in {HSC} activation, and a significant decrease in the levels of inflammatory and profibrotic markers compared with controls. Conclusion: We have successfully developed a microfluidic {NASH}-on-a-chip platform that recapitulates the main {NASH} histologic endpoints in a single chip and that can emerge as a powerful noninvasive, human-relevant, in vitro platform to study disease pathogenesis and develop novel anti-{NASH} drugs.},

	abstract = {Background \& Aims
Ethanol-inducible cytochrome P450 2E1 ({CYP}2E1) activity contributes to oxidative stress. However, {CYP}2E1 may have an important role in the pathogenesis of high-fat mediated nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ({NASH}). Thus, the role of {CYP}2E1 in high-fat mediated {NASH} development was evaluated.

Methods
Male wild-type ({WT}) and Cyp2e1-null mice were fed a low-fat diet ({LFD}, 10\% energy-derived) or high-fat diet ({HFD}, 60\% energy-derived) for 10 weeks. Liver histology and tissue homogenates were examined for various parameters of oxidative stress and inflammation.

Results
Liver histology showed that only {WT} mice fed a {HFD} developed {NASH} despite increased steatosis in both {WT} and Cyp2e1-null mice fed {HFD}. Markers of oxidative stress such as elevated {CYP}2E1 activity and protein amounts, lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation, nitration, and glycation with increased phospho-{JNK} were all markedly elevated only in the livers of {HFD}-fed {WT} mice. Furthermore, while the levels of inflammation markers osteopontin and F4/80 were higher in {HFD}-fed {WT} mice, {TNFα} and {MCP}-1 contents were lower compared to the corresponding {LFD}-fed {WT}. Finally, only {HFD}-fed {WT} mice exhibited increased insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance.

Conclusions
These data suggest that {CYP}2E1 is critically important in {NASH} development by promoting oxidative/nitrosative stress, protein modifications, inflammation and insulin resistance.},

  abstract     = {Human induced pluripotent stem cell derived brain organoids have shown great potential for studies of human brain development and neurological disorders. However, quantifying the evolution of the electrical properties of brain organoids during development is currently limited by the measurement techniques, which cannot provide long-term stable 3D bioelectrical interfaces with developing brain organoids. Here, a cyborg brain organoid platform is reported, in which “tissue-like” stretchable mesh nanoelectronics are designed to match the mechanical properties of brain organoids and to be folded by the organogenetic process of progenitor or stem cells, distributing stretchable electrode arrays across the 3D organoids. The tissue-wide integrated stretchable electrode arrays show no interruption to brain organoid development, adapt to the volume and morphological changes during brain organoid organogenesis, and provide long-term stable electrical contacts with neurons within brain organoids during development. The seamless and noninvasive coupling of electrodes to neurons enables long-term stable, continuous recording and captures the emergence of single-cell action potentials from early-stage brain organoid development.},

  abstract     = {Human brain organoids represent remarkable platforms for recapitulating features of human brain development and diseases. Existing organoid models do not resolve fine brain subregions, such as different nuclei in the hypothalamus. We report the generation of arcuate organoids ({ARCOs}) from human induced pluripotent stem cells ({iPSCs}) to model the development of the human hypothalamic arcuate nucleus. Single-cell {RNA} sequencing of {ARCOs} revealed significant molecular heterogeneity underlying different arcuate cell types, and machine learning-aided analysis based on the neonatal human hypothalamus single-nucleus transcriptome further showed a human arcuate nucleus molecular signature. We also explored {ARCOs} generated from Prader-Willi syndrome ({PWS}) patient {iPSCs}. These organoids exhibit aberrant differentiation and transcriptomic dysregulation similar to postnatal hypothalamus of {PWS} patients, indicative of cellular differentiation deficits and exacerbated inflammatory responses. Thus, patient {iPSC}-derived {ARCOs} represent a promising experimental model for investigating nucleus-specific features and disease-relevant mechanisms during early human arcuate development.},
