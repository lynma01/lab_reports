	abstract = {Angiogenesis is an important component of pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease ({IBD}). Chronic inflammation and angiogenesis are two closely related processes. Chronic intestinal inflammation is dependent on angiogenesis and this angiogenesis is modulated by immune system in {IBD}. Angiogenesis is a very complex process which includes multiple cell types, growth factors, cytokines, adhesion molecules, and signal transduction. Lymphangiogenesis is a new research area in the pathogenesis of {IBD}. While angiogenesis supports inflammation via leukocyte migration, carrying oxygen and nutrients, on the other hand, it has a major role in wound healing. Angiogenic molecules look like perfect targets for the treatment of {IBD}, but they have risk for serious side effects because of their nature.},

Although the principle mechanisms of migration follow a defined general motility cycle, the cell type and the context of moving influences the detailed mode of migration. Endothelial cells migrate during vasculogenesis and angiogenesis but also in a damaged vessel to restore vessel integrity. Depending on the situation they migrate individually, in chains or sheets and complex signaling, intercellular signals as well as environmental cues modulate the process. Here, the different modes of cell migration, the peculiarities of endothelial cell migration and specific guidance molecules controlling this process will be reviewed.},

	abstract = {Sulforaphane ({SUL}), an isothiocyanate derived from broccoli and other cruciferous vegetables, is known to induce phase {II} detoxification enzymes, disrupt cancer cell microtubule polymerization, and trigger cell cycle arrest in breast and colon cancer cells. Here, we provide the first evidence that {SUL} also acts to inhibit angiogenesis via suppression of endothelial cellproliferation. Bovine aortic endothelial ({BAE}) cells were exposed to concentrations of up to 15 μM {SUL} prior to cell cycle analysis and mitotic index quantification. Within 24 h, 15 μM {SUL} clearly induced G2/M accumulation and pre-metaphase arrest in {BAE} cells. Moreover, immunofluorescence tubulin staining indicated that this same {SUL} concentration was efficacious in not only disrupting mitotic progression, but also in perturbing normal polymerization of mitotic (and cytoplasmic) microtubules. Furthermore, daily administration of {SUL} (100 nmol/day, i.v. for 7 days) to female Balb/c mice bearing {VEGF}-impregnated Matrigel plugs strongly and significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) suppressed angiogenesis progression as measured by hemoglobin concentration. Taken together, these findings suggest that the endothelial cell population is a novel target of {SUL} action both in vitro and in vivo. This mechanism of {SUL}-induced endothelial microtubule disruption and early mitotic arrest may further discern a potential role of {SUL} as a chemopreventive agent. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

              Angiogenesis plays an important role in hepatocellular carcinoma ({HCC}), the inhibition of which is explored for cancer prevention and treatment. The dietary phytochemical sulforaphane ({SFN}) is known for its anti-cancer properties
              in vitro
              and
              in vivo
              ; but until now, no study has focused on the role of {SFN} in {HCC} tumor angiogenesis. In the present study,
              in vitro
              cell models using a {HCC} cell line, {HepG}2, and human endothelial cells, {HUVECs}, as well as
              ex vivo
              and
              in vivo
              models have been used to investigate the anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic effect of {SFN}. The results showed that {SFN} decreased {HUVEC} cell viability, migration and tube formation, all of which are important steps in angiogenesis. More importantly, {SFN} markedly supressed {HepG}2-stimulated {HUVEC} migration, adhesion and tube formation; which may be due to its inhibition on {STAT}3/{HIF}-1α/{VEGF} signalling in {HepG}2 cells. In addition, {SFN} significantly reduced {HepG}2 tumor growth in a modified chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane ({CAM}) assay, associated with a decrease of {HIF}-1α and {VEGF} expression within tumors. Collectively, these findings provide new insights into the inhibitory effect of {SFN} on {HCC} tumor angiogenesis as well as tumor growth, and indicate that {SFN} has potential for the prevention and treatment of {HCC}.},

	abstract = {Objectives—The mechanisms involved in activating pericytes, cells that ensheath capillaries, to engage in the formation of new capillaries, angiogenesis, remain unknown. In this study, the hypothesis was tested that pericytes could be stimulated to promote angiogenesis by driving the hypoxia-inducible factor ({HIF}) pathway.
Methods—Pericytes were stimulated with cobalt chloride ({CoCl}2) to activate the {HIF} pathway. Stimulated pericytes were co-cultured with endothelial cells in a wound healing assay and in a 3D collagen matrix assay of angiogenesis. A culture system of spinal cord tissue was used to assess microvascular outcomes after treatment with stimulated pericytes. Pharmaceutical inhibition of exosome production was also performed.
Results—Treatment with stimulated pericytes resulted in faster wound healing (1.92 ± 0.18 fold increase, p {\textless} 0.05), greater endothelial cord formation (2.9 ± 0.14 fold increase, p {\textless} 0.05) in cell culture assays and greater vascular density (1.78 ± 0.23 fold increase, p {\textless} 0.05) in spinal cord tissue. Exosome secretion and the physical presence of stimulated pericytes were necessary in the promotion of angiogenic outcomes.
Conclusions—These results elucidate a mechanism that may be exploited to enhance features of angiogenesis in the central nervous system ({CNS}).},

	abstract = {The vascular endothelial growth factors ({VEGFs}) and their receptors ({VEGFRs}) play crucial roles in vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. Angiogenesis is an important mechanism in many physiological and pathological processes, and is involved in endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and survival, then leads to further tubulogenesis, and ﬁnally promotes formation of vessels. This series of signaling cascade pathways are precisely mediated by {VEGF}/{VEGFR}-2 system. The {VEGF} binding to the {IgD}2 and {IgD}3 of {VEGFR}-2 induces the dimerization of the receptor, subsequently the activation and trans-autophosphorylation of the tyrosine kinase, and then the initiation of the intracellular signaling cascades. Finally the {VEGF}-activated {VEGFR}-2 stimulates and mediates variety of signaling transduction, biological responses, and pathological processes in angiogenesis. Several crucial phosphorylated sites Tyr801, Try951, Try1175, and Try1214 in the {VEGFR}-2 intracellular domains mediate several key signaling processes including {PLCγ}-{PKC}, {TSAd}-Src-{PI}3K-Akt, {SHB}-{FAK}-paxillin, {SHBPI}3K-Akt, and {NCK}-p38-{MAPKAPK}2/3 pathways. Based on the molecular structure and signaling pathways of {VEGFR}-2, the strategy of the {VEGFR}-2-targeted therapy should be considered to employ in the treatment of the {VEGF}/{VEGFR}-2-associated diseases by blocking the {VEGF}/{VEGFR}-2 signaling pathway, inhibiting {VEGF} and {VEGFR}-2 gene expression, blocking the binding of {VEGF} and {VEGFR}-2, and preventing the proliferation, migration, and survival of vascular endothelial cells expressing {VEGFR}-2.},

Therefore, an in-depth study on the role of {HIF}-1α in solid tumor malignancies is required to develop novel anti-cancer therapeutics. {HIF}-1α also plays a critical role in regulating growth factors, such as the vascular endothelial growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, and platelet-derived growth factor, in a network manner. Additionally, it plays a significant role in tumor progression and chemotherapy resistance by regulating a variety of angiogenic factors, including angiopoietin 1 and angiopoietin 2, matrix metalloproteinase, and erythropoietin, along with energy pathways. Therefore, this review attempts to provide comprehensive insight into the role of {HIF}-1α in the energy and angiogenesis pathways of solid tumors.},
