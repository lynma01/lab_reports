              Quantitative and reliable measurement of cellular invasion is important to understand a range of biological processes such as cancer metastasis and angiogenesis. Spheroid invasion assays are an attractive
              in vitro
              platform because they effectively mimic the tumor cell invasion of solid tissues. Here, we developed an image analysis–based method to quantify the invasiveness of {HT}1080 human fibrosarcoma tumor cell spheroids. We segmented a cell-covered area into three subareas using objectively set threshold pixel intensities and calculated invasion indices using these subareas. Comparison with conventional parameters for spheroid invasion assays, such as area, length, and detached cells, showed that our indices present the invasion event at an early time and without being convoluted by proliferation. As an application, we then examined paracrine interactions between {LLC}1 mouse lung carcinoma cells and Raw264.7 mouse macrophage cells with our developed analysis method. We found that the invasion of tumor spheroids was increased by a macrophage-conditioned medium, concomitantly with a decrease in tumor cell proliferation. Importantly, invasion was further enhanced by a conditioned medium from activated macrophages by co-culture with tumor cells. Thus, our indices reveal that tumor cell invasion is facilitated in a feed-forward manner by communication between tumor cells and macrophages in the tumor microenvironment.},

	abstract = {The development of safe, effective and patient-acceptable drug products is an expensive and lengthy process and the risk of failure at different stages of the development life-cycle is high. Improved biopharmaceutical tools which are robust, easy to use and accurately predict the in vivo response are urgently required to help address these issues. In this review the advantages and challenges of in vitro 3D versus 2D cell culture models will be discussed in terms of evaluating new drug products at the pre-clinical development stage. Examples of models with a 3D architecture including scaffolds, cell-derived matrices, multicellular spheroids and biochips will be described. The ability to simulate the microenvironment of tumours and vital organs including the liver, kidney, heart and intestine which have major impact on drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and toxicity will be evaluated. Examples of the application of 3D models including a role in formulation development, pharmacokinetic profiling and toxicity testing will be critically assessed. Although utilisation of 3D cell culture models in the field of drug delivery is still in its infancy, the area is attracting high levels of interest and is likely to become a significant in vitro tool to assist in drug product development thus reducing the requirement for unnecessary animal studies.},

	abstract = {Invasion of surrounding normal tissues is generally considered to be a key hallmark of malignant (as opposed to benign) tumors. For some cancers in particular (e.g., brain tumors such as glioblastoma multiforme and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck – {SCCHN}) it is a cause of severe morbidity and can be life-threatening even in the absence of distant metastases. In addition, cancers which have relapsed following treatment unfortunately often present with a more aggressive phenotype. Therefore, there is an opportunity to target the process of invasion to provide novel therapies that could be complementary to standard anti-proliferative agents. Until now, this strategy has been hampered by the lack of robust, reproducible assays suitable for a detailed analysis of invasion and for drug screening. Here we provide a simple micro-plate method (based on uniform, self-assembling 3D tumor spheroids) which has great potential for such studies. We exemplify the assay platform using a human glioblastoma cell line and also an {SCCHN} model where the development of resistance against targeted epidermal growth factor receptor ({EGFR}) inhibitors is associated with enhanced matrix-invasive potential. We also provide two alternative methods of semiautomated quantification: one using an imaging cytometer and a second which simply requires standard microscopy and image capture with digital image analysis.},

  abstract     = {Antimetabolites are a class of effective anticancer drugs interfering in essential biochemical processes. 5-Fluorouracil (5-{FU}) and its prodrug Capecitabine are widely used in the treatment of several solid tumors (gastro-intestinal, gynecological, head and neck, breast carcinomas). Therapy with fluoropyrimidines is associated with a wide range of adverse effects, including diarrhea, dehydration, abdominal pain, nausea, stomatitis, and hand-foot syndrome. Among the 5-{FU} side effects, increasing attention is given to cardiovascular toxicities induced at different levels and intensities. Since the mechanisms related to 5-{FUinduced} cardiotoxicity are still unclear, we examined the effects of 5-{FU} on primary cell cultures of human cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells, which represent two key components of the cardiovascular system. We analyzed at the cellular and molecular level 5-{FU} effects on cell proliferation, cell cycle, survival and induction of apoptosis, in an experimental cardioncology approach. We observed autophagic features at the ultrastructural and molecular levels, in particular in 5-{FU} exposed cardiomyocytes. Reactive oxygen species ({ROS}) elevation characterized the endothelial response. These responses were prevented by a {ROS} scavenger. We found induction of a senescent phenotype on both cell types treated with 5FU. In vivo, in a xenograft model of colon cancer, we showed that 5-{FU} treatment induced ultrastructural changes in the endothelium of various organs. Taken together, our data suggest that 5-{FU} can affect, both at the cellular and molecular levels, two key cell types of the cardiovascular system, potentially explaining some manifestations of 5-{FU}-induced cardiovascular toxicity.},

  abstract     = {Tumours often display invasive behaviours that induce fingering, branching and fragmentation processes. The phenomenon, known as diffusional instability, is driven by differential cell proliferation, migration, and death due to the presence of metabolite and catabolite concentration gradients. An understanding of the intricate dynamics of this spatially heterogeneous process plays a key role in the investigation of tumour growth and invasion. In this study, we developed an in vitro tumour invasion assay to investigate cell invasiveness in tumour spheroids under a chemotactic stimulus. Our method, employing tumour spheroids seeded in a 3D collagen gel within a microfluidic chemotaxis chamber, focuses on the role of diffusive gradients. Using Time‑Lapse Microscopy, the dynamic evolution of tumour spheroids was monitored in real‑time, providing a comprehensive view of the morphological changes and cell migration patterns under different chemotactic conditions. Specifically, we explored the impact of fetal bovine serum ({FBS}) gradients on the behaviour of {CT}26 mouse colon carcinoma cells and compared the effects of varying {FBS} concentrations to two isotropic control conditions. Furthermore, a finite element in silico model was developed to quantify the diffusive flow of nutrients in the chemotaxis chamber and obtain a detailed understanding of tumour dynamics. Our findings reveal that the presence of a chemotactic gradient significantly influences tumour invasiveness, with higher concentrations of nutrients associated with increased cancer growth and cell migration.},
