# Objective

This experiment has three components: 1) knock-out a gene-of-interest in *E. coli* using the CRISPR-CAS9 technique, 2) quantify the viral load of two patient samples using the plaque assay, and finally 3) analyze the morphology of cancer cells from stained, rehydrated slides using a compound microscope.

### Principles of CRISPR-CAS9

CRISPR/Cas9 is a naturally occurring immune system in bacteria with two primary components: a CAS9 Protein: A nuclease that cuts DNA like a pair of "molecular scissors", with Cas9 being the most commonly used type in genome editing; and a Short Guide RNA (sgRNA): A small RNA molecule that guides the CAS9 nuclease to cut a specific nucleotide sequence.

### Experimental Application of CRISPR-CAS9

The experiment uses an sgRNA which targets the *lacZ* gene in *E. coli*, which encodes the Î²-galactosidase enzyme. The knockout of the *lacZ* gene allows for a visual test verifying the genetic edit:

$\beta$-galactosidase cleaves the lactose analog X-gal, producing a blue precipitate and indicates the presence of a functional *lacZ* gene. White colonies, on the other hand, indicate the *lacZ* gene has been successfully knocked out.

*E. coli* bacteria used in the experiment don't naturally contain the CAS9 protein. As a result, 

- **pKO Plasmid:** Contains the *cas9* gene and instructions for a guide RNA that's complementary to the *lacZ* gene

- **pCtrl Plasmid:** Contains the *cas9* gene and instructions for a sgRNA with a random sequence. 

The bacteria are grown on plates containing X-gal. The color of the resulting bacterial colonies helps determine if the CAS9 protein successfully disabled the *lacZ* gene:

- Blue colonies indicate that the *lacZ* gene is functional, implying the Cas9 protein didn't disable the *lacZ* gene.

- White colonies indicate that the *lacZ* gene has been disabled, implying the CAS9 protein, guided by the *lacZ*-specific sgRNA, cut the *lacZ* gene, knocking  out its ability to produce $\beta$-galactosidase.

## Quantifying viral load using the Plaque Assay

### Conceptual Summary of the Plaque Assay

The plaque assay is a virological technique used to quantify the number of infectious viral particles in a sample, also known as the viral load. Monitoring viral load is crucial for evaluating the success of the treatment and detecting the development of antiviral resistance. 

The Plaque Assay relies on the ability of a single virus to infect a host cell and spread the infection to neighboring cells, ultimately leading to the formation of a visible zone of cell death called "plaques". 

### Experimental Application of the Plaque Assay

The experiment uses the plaque assay to simulate measuring the viral load of two patients undergoing antiviral treatment for HIV. The protocol's primary steps are described as follows:

- **Serial dilution of the suspected infected blood sample:** This is done because the viral concentration can vary significantly, and dilutions help ensure at least some plates will have a countable number of plaques.

- **Inoculation of host cell culture with each dilution:** This provides a suitable environment for the virus to infect cells.

- **Incubation period:** Allows time for the virus to attach to and infect the host cells.

- **Addition of an agar layer:** The agar restricts the vertical movement of the virus, ensuring that infection spreads only to neighboring cells in a horizontal plane.

- **Second incubation period:** This allows for the formation of plaques, which appear as circular zones of infected, dead cells.

- **Calculation of viral load:** **The viral load is expressed as plaque-forming units (PFU) per milliliter**. Only plates containing between 30 and 300 plaques are considered for calculations to ensure accuracy and account for variations in counting.[^la_9]

- **Incorporation of the dilution factor:** The final PFU/ml value is adjusted based on the dilution factor of the specific sample used.

By comparing the viral load before and during treatment, the experiment simulates how doctors evaluate the effectiveness of the antiviral therapy.  **The shared results and analysis in the classroom setting provide a comprehensive understanding of the treatment outcomes for both patients**.
