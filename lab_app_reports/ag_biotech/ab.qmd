# Objective
## Experiment 1: qPCR
The objective of this experiment is to determine whether food samples have come from genetically modified organisms (GMOs) by conducting a PCR analysis to amplify sample DNA to screen for common Multiple Cloning Sites (MCS) and transgenes commonly used in genetic engineering.[^edvotek]

## Experiment 2: Western Blot
The secondary objective of this experiment was to test the presence of Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) 

# Background
This experiment relies on several fundamental concepts in molecular biology to identify genetically modified organisms in food samples.

## **Genetically Modified Organisms** (GMOs): 
GMOs are organisms whose DNA has been engineered to contain desired traits, such as insect resistance or enhanced nutritional value, from other organisms. These genetically encoded traits are called "Transgenes".

## **Transgenes and their Components**: 
A transgene is an artifically inserted gene which has been transferred from one organism to another. For a transgene to function successfully, it requires specific genetic components:

   - **Promoter**: This DNA sequence initiates the transcription of the transgene, which is translated to produce the desired protein. The experiment uses the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus (CaMV) promoter as evidence of genetic modification because of its versatility across different species.

   - **Terminator**: This sequence signals the end of transcription, ensuring that the transgene is transcribed correctly into resulting protein.

## **Polymerase Chain Reaction** (PCR): 
This experiment uses PCR to amplify DNA from the food samples to ensure there's enough sample genetic material to accurately screen for different markers of genetic manipulation.

Specifically, we're using PCR to amplify any samples of the ***CaMV 35S Promoter*** and the ***B. thuringiensis cry1F Gene***. The *cry1F* gene is notable because it encodes an insecticidal protein which improves the plants resistance against insect-pests. Because of its absence in wild phenotypes of different agricultural species, its presence is a marker for certain GMOs.

## **Gel Electrophoresis**: 
This experiment requires gel electrophoresis technique to differentiate DNA fragments. In the presence of both a Base Pair ladder, as well as a GMO Chloroplast we can visually compare our food samples to the control to qualitatively confirm/deny the presence of transgenes in the samples.

## **Western Blots**:
Western Blots are a form of immunological detection which uses the affinity of a given antibody to bind to the specific protein-of-interest. In this case, we're using a primary antibody to bind to the Bovine Serum Albumin protein and a secondary reporter antibody (HRP) which binds to the primary antibody and allows for visualization of the protein on the membrane.[^la_6]

# Interpretation & Discussion

## Analyzing transgene presence in food samples via gel electrophoresis{#sec-gel-results}

From @fig-gel-pic, we can conclude that specific samples within the gel electrophoresis contain transgenes given the similarity of their banding patterns to the GMO control in well #2:

|Well Position|Sample Contents|Analysis|
|---|---|---|
|1 | 1000 kbp Ladder | Used for visual comparison of quantities of DNA Base Pairs.|
|2 | GMO Positive Control (GPC) | Genetically modified plant chloroplast cells used as positive control/reference for known GMO containing sample.|
|3 | Sample 1 (V) | Comparison to GPC suggests the presence of GMO transgenes within the sample.|
|4 | Sample 2 (B) | Banding compared to Wells 2, 3, 5 are faint, however, presence of bands in the same BP range as the GPC ambiguously suggests the presence of GMO transgenes.|
|5 | Sample 1 (V) | Sample is very similar to Well 3, suggesting both the presence of GMO transgenes and that the samples came from extremely similar sources.|
|6 | Sample 3 (C) | Outlier compared to other well samples and is distinct from GPC, suggesting the absence of GMO transgenes found in other wells and the sample came from a novel source.|

From @fig-gel-pic transillumination capture of gel electrophoresis.

Of note, Wells #5, #6 were prepared and contributed by Sophia Levit, and Henry Ware[^sophie_henry] while wells #3, and #4 were contributed by the author and Adesh Suchit[^adesh]. All samples were prepared by, and collected from the same source.

As elucidated in @sec-gel-results, comparing the banding patterns against well #2, we can confirm the presence of transgenes within wells #3, #5, their ambiguous presence in well #4, and their absence in well #6.

### Examination of outliers, wells #4 and #6

Well #4 has faint banding patterns compared to that of wells #3, #5, and because of that faintness, well #4 *potentially* contains transgenes given the similarity of its banding pattern to the GPC in well #2.

Well #6, on the other hand, does not contain banding patterns similar to the GPC in well #2, suggesting the ***absence*** of CaMV/cry1F transgenes. The banding pattern within this well is distinct from all other wells in the electrophoresis gel. We can conclude that the sample is likewise unique, and does not contain transgenes.

## Western Blot screening for BSA presence

### Distinct banding patterns suggesting BSA are absent from the membrane

Despite the application of two different substrates between @fig-wb-results and @fig-wb-results-2, distinct banding patterns demonstrating BSA presence were absent from the membrane. 

Potential causes for this phenomena would include the duration and frequency of washing the membrane with distilled water before and after the addition of substrates after a rest period. This is a crucial step in the process because it removes unbound antibodies which would obstruct colormetric signals.

Therefore, we cannot confirm presence in the membrane despite the presence of the protein ladder across the center of the membrane. 

### Polyacrylamide gel artifact on the membrane {#sec-gel-artifact}

In the process of loading the membrane and the gel into the Trans-Blot Turbo Instrument (TBTI), sections of the SDS-PAGE gel used to denature the sample proteins into their primary structures were applied onto the membrane placed within the TBTI. This resulted in a small artifact on the membrane near the center of the membrane.

# Study Questions
## Agricultural Biotechnology
### What would you expect to see if the blocking step was missed? Why would you have that result?
If the blocking step is missed in a Western Blot, the antibodies used for detection could bind to the membrane **nonspecifically**, instead of just the target protein. This would cause the antibodies to bind directly to the entire membrane instead of the protein of interest. (see also @sec-sq-blocking-agent)

### Certain brain diseases can only be detected by Western Blot (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy is one of them) why can you only use Western Blot and not PCR?

This is because diseases like BSE are caused by the presence of prions; misfolded proteins which cause other healthy proteins within the brain to also misfold. Detecting prion proteins is crucial for diagnosing BSE.

Thus of the two tools, a Western Blot is the only one which can detect BSE because it can identify the presence of prions. PCR, focusing on DNA amplification, wouldn't be effective because it has no mechanism for screening gene expression of proteins.

### How are genes from different species correctly translated in GMO plants?
Genes from different species are translated into GMO plants via the introduction of *universal promoters*, which include *terminator sequences*, to overcome any *codon usage bias* and ensure their proper *protein folding and modification*. 

*   **Universal Promoters:** Promoters like CaMV are recognized by many different plant species during transcription. This means that a single promoter can be used to drive the expression of a transgene in a variety of plants. 

*   **Terminator Sequences:** In addition to a promoter, a transgene also needs a terminator sequence to signal RNA polymerase to end transcription.

*   **Codon Usage Bias:** Different organisms may have preferences for using certain codons over others, even if they code for the same amino acid.

*   **Protein Folding and Modification:** Proteins may require specific chaperone proteins or post-translational modifications to fold correctly and function properly, which might differ between species.

### What region of the Ti plasmid of Agrobacterium tumefaciens carries genes into the plant cell chromosomes?

The region of the *Agrobacterium tumefaciens* plasmid which carries genes into the plant cell chromosomes is called the *T-DNA* or "Transferred DNA". 

### What do the normal genes in the Ti plasmid code for (Auxin, cytokinin and opine)?
Normal genes in the Ti plasmid of *Agrobacterium tumefaciens* typically code for:

*   **Auxin and Cytokinin:** plant hormones promoting cell division and growth. The genes responsible for their production in the Ti plasmid lead to the overproduction of these hormones in infected plant cells, resulting in the formation of crown gall tumors, a characteristic symptom of *Agrobacterium* infection.[^auxin_wikipedia] [^cytokinin_wikipedia]

*   **Opines:** Opines are amino acid derivatives that are produced and secreted by the plant cells transformed by the T-DNA. The Ti plasmid also contains genes that allow *Agrobacterium* to metabolize and utilize these opines as a nutrient source. This gives the bacteria a competitive advantage, as other microbes in the environment typically cannot utilize opines.[^opines_wikipedia]

## Western Blot Study Questions

### What is the western blot procedure used to detect?
The Western blot procedure is used to detect the presence of a specific protein within a complex mixture of proteins. For example, Western blots are used for detecting viral proteins, characterizing monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, and assessing immune responses to viral antigens.[^la_6]

### Why are polyacrylamide gels commonly used for the electrophoresis of proteins (SDS-PAGE) rather than agarose gels? What is the purpose of the gel system?

Polyacrylamide gels are favored over agarose gels for protein electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) for their smaller pore size, and thus higher resolution results. Polyacrylamide gels can separate proteins with smaller size differences more effectively. 

The general purpose of the gel systems is to separate the well contents into distinct bands for identification and analysis. Agarose gels, with their larger pores, are better suited for separating larger molecules like DNA, while the polyacrylamid gels in SDS-PAGE are used to identify/analyze specific proteins.

### What is the purpose of the blocking agent? What would happen if you forgot to add the blocking agent? {#sec-sq-blocking-agent}

The blocking agent prevents non-specific binding of antibodies to the membrane by filling unoccupied binding sites with proteins, thus minimizing background noise and ensuring that the detected signal is specifically from the target protein.

If the blocking agent is omitted, the antibodies bind randomly to the membrane, making the ratio of background "noise" to assay "signal" extremely unfavorable, resulting in inaccurate or unreliable results.

### What is the purpose of the secondary antibody?

This secondary antibody is typically conjugated to a reporter molecule, such as horseradish peroxidase (HRP)[^la_6]. Because the secondary antibody is designed to bind specifically to the primary antibody, it acts as a method of "reporting" via colormetric signal in the Western Blot membrane, the presence of the protein-of-interest.

### What are some of the detection methods used in Western Blot?

Several detection methods are available for Western blots, with the choice depending on factors like sensitivity, cost, and equipment availability.

- **Colorimetric Detection:** Uses substrates that produce a colored product upon reaction with the enzyme conjugated to the secondary antibody. This method is relatively inexpensive and straightforward but offers lower sensitivity.

- **Chemiluminescent Detection:** Employs substrates that emit light upon reaction with the enzyme. This method is highly sensitive and widely used, allowing for the detection of even low-abundance proteins. The light signal can be captured on X-ray film or using specialized imaging systems.[^la_6]
