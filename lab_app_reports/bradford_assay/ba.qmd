# Objective

The objective of the experiment is to measure the purity/specific activity of enzyme activity using the Bradford Coomassie Blue Assay, and the $\beta$-galactosidase assay with O-nitrophenyl-$\beta$-D-galactopyranoside (ONPG) artificial substrate. 

The Bradford Assay (BA) will be used to quantify the total protein concentration at different stages of the purification process. While the $\beta$-galactosidase assay will be used to derive the specific activity of the enzyme present.

# Background
## Principles Behind the Bradford Assay for Protein Quantification

- **Color Change Upon Protein Binding:** The Bradford assay leverages a dye called Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250. This dye exists in different ionic forms, with varying colors depending on the pH of the solution.  In its acidic form, the dye appears reddish-brown. However, when the dye binds to protein molecules, it undergoes a shift to its anionic form, resulting in a vivid blue color. This color change is directly proportional to the amount of protein present in the sample.[^edvotek]

- **Mechanism of Dye-Protein Interaction:** The color shift occurs due to the dye's interaction with specific amino acids within the protein structure. Primarily, Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 binds to basic amino acids, particularly arginine, and to a lesser extent, aromatic amino acids like tryptophan, tyrosine, and histidine. This binding stabilizes the anionic, blue form of the dye.

- **Spectrophotometry for Quantification:**  The intensity of the blue color is measured using a spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 420nm.  The higher the protein concentration, the more intense the blue color, the higher the absorbance reading at 420nm.

- **Standard Curve for Calibration:** A standard curve is generated using known concentrations of a reference protein, and for this experiment, Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA). The absorbance readings of known BSA concentrations are plotted against their corresponding unknown concentrations to create a curve relating absorbance to protein concentration.

- Lac- samples have a greater estimated amount of BSA Equivalent than Lac+ samples. This implies that Lac- samples have a greater concentration of their respective proteins than the Lac+ sample.

# Interpretation & Discussion

## Interpreting the difference between Specific Activity vs. Protein Concentration for Lac+/- Samples.

Results from @sec-bga-assay suggests that the Lac+ samples have at least ~4x the Specific Enzyme Activity that the Lac- samples do. However, we can see that there's a fractionally higher concentration of Lac- vs. Lac+ proteins in @sec-avg-bsa-eqv.

These results suggest that while the concentration of Lac- proteins is greater than the Lac+ proteins, the enzymes in the Lac+ samples are more active than the Lac- ones. Thus, while the Lac- samples have a higher concentration, they have more inactive enzymes than Lac+ samples. 

### Explanations for samples measuring specific activity for ONPG despite being Lac-

Within both @fig-sa-plot and @fig-lac-bath, there remains ONPG activity of unexplained origin. Random noise appears to be the most reasonable source of the specific activity within the sample given that the value for mean background absorbance within the Spectrophotomer readings within @fig-ba-final-data were 0.302 at $OD_{420}$, close fo the values used for the Lac-specific activity equation in @sec-sa-data-table. 

A less-likely potential explanation for the *E. coli* bacteria producing specific activity despite being Lac- could be that there are other naturally-produced enzymes by *E. coli* which were able to cleave the lactose analog ONPG. Therefore, even though the bacterial cells did not contain any inserts of the Lac gene, they'd be able to cleave the lactose analog and produce the small amount of specific activity seen in @fig-sa-plot.

# Study Questions
## Why do proteins precipitate during "salting out" with ammonium sulfate?

Proteins dissolve in water because of interactions between their charged/polar groups and water molecules. Adding a high concentration of salt, like ammonium sulfate, disrupts these interactions by out-competing the protein for hydrogen-bonds with water molecules.

As the salt concentration increases, and there are fewer water molecules to interact with the protein, the proteins are forced to aggregate together leading to their precipitation out of solution.

## What physical property governs protein migration during centrifugation?

When a solution containing proteins is centrifuged, denser proteins move towards the bottom of the centrifuge tube faster than less dense proteins. The mass of a protein also influences its sedimentation rate - heavier particles sediment faster than lighter ones under the same centrifugal force.

## How does the Bradford assay determine protein concentration?

The Bradford assay uses a dye called Coomassie Blue to measure protein concentration.[^la_7] The color change from redish-brown in an acid environment, to bright blue, is proportional to the amount of protein present. The assay involves these steps:

- **Preparing a standard curve**: Known concentrations of a standard protein like BSA are reacted with the Bradford reagent. A spectrophotometer measures the absorbance of these solutions at 420nm, and a standard curve with absorbance on the y-axis and protein concentration on the x-axis is plotted.

- **Sample measurement**: The unknown protein sample is reacted with the Bradford reagent, and its absorbance at 420nm is measured.

- **Determining the unknown concentration**: By comparing the absorbance of the unknown sample to the standard curve, the corresponding protein concentration can be determined.

## To measure the amount of a specific enzyme, which method is preferred: Bradford assay or activity assay?

An activity assay is the preferred method for measuring the amount of a specific enzyme in a solution because it can distinguish between the active vs. inactive forms of the enzyme. Inactive enzymes may inaccurately inflate the final count of a specific enzyme.

## In the β-galactosidase assay, the amount of o-nitrophenol produced correlates with what?

In the $\beta$-galactosidase assay, the higher the $\beta$-galactosidase activity, the more ONPG is cleaved, and consequently, the more o-nitrophenol is produced.[^la_7] This is because ONPG is an analog of lactose, a molecule which is cleaved by $\beta$-galactosidase activity into o-nitrophenol.
