# Study Questions


## What is Affinity Chromatography?
Affinity chromatography is used to purify proteins with tags like His6. The His6 tag binds specifically to nickel ions (Ni2+) that are immobilized on the chromatography resin. 

This interaction allows the tagged protein to be retained on the column while other proteins are washed away. The His6-tagged protein can then be eluted from the column using a solution containing a high concentration of imidazole, which competes with the histidine residues for binding to the nickel ions.

## What type of chromatography is used to purify EcoR1 and why?
Ion exchange chromatography is used to purify EcoR1. This method separates proteins based on their net charge. The resin used in this experiment, DEAE Cellulose, has a positive charge. EcoR1, being negatively charged, binds to the positively charged resin.

## How is the protein concentration measured in this experiment? What is the limitation of this method?
Protein concentration in this experiment is measured using **A280**, which measures the absorbance of a sample at a wavelength of 280 nm. This method is based on the fact that aromatic amino acids like tryptophan and tyrosine absorb light at 280 nm. 

The limitation of this method is that it is not specific for a particular protein and can be affected by the presence of other molecules that absorb light at 280 nm.

## Why is KCl used to elute the protein from the column matrix?
KCl is used to elute the protein from the column matrix because it increases the ionic strength of the buffer, disrupting the ionic interactions between the protein and the charged resin, allowing the protein to be eluted.

## What is the difference between Molarity and Normality?
**Molarity (M)** is defined as the number of moles of solute per liter of solution, while **Normality (N)** is defined as the number of gram equivalents of solute per liter of solution. One gram equivalent of a substance is defined as the mass of the substance that can donate or accept one mole of protons.
