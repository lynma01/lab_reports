The rate at which acetate forms is directly related to the rate at which the cells grow or the rate at which they consume the usual substrate, glucose.” (Eiteman and Altman, 2006, p. 530) When do E. coli cells begin secreting acetate?“That is, regardless of how quickly oxygen is supplied to the bioreactor, E. coli can only consume oxygen up to a maximum rate [5]. This plateau in oxygen consumption corresponds with the threshold growth rate at which acetate formation begins (Figure 1).” (Eiteman and Altman, 2006, p. 530)“Because glucose in particular appears to trigger acetate formation, acetate accumulation can be reduced by replacing glucose with mannose [37] or fructose [38]. For example, reduced acetate and a 65\% increase in protein yield have been reported when fructose was the carbon source instead of glucose in batch culture [38].” (Eiteman and Altman, 2006, p. 531) Glucose in particular appears to trigger acetate formation.“The reduced maximum growth rate of E. coli in glycerol compared with glucose is less of a problem in fed-batch processes, and recent results have demonstrated glycerol is superior to glucose for reduced acetate and increased recombinant protein formation when supplied post-induction [41].” (Eiteman and Altman, 2006, p. 531) Glycerol is actually superior to glucose...(Eiteman and Altman, 2006, p. 531)

                  Summary
                  “Feeding was carried out to increase the cell mass concentration exponentially in the bioreactor controlling biomass accumulation at growth rates which do not cause the formation of acetic acid.” (Korz et al., 1995, p. 59) 
                  The concern of this paper was controlling acetic acid concentration caused by excess carbon or deficient oxygen in the bioreactor.
                  The authors attempted to circumvent these problems by instituting a fed-batch feeding algorithm. The experiment worked; with glucose and glycerol supplemented minimal media respectively reaching 58\% and 67\% of the theoretical maximum yield of an E. coli culture.
                  Glycerol is superior?
                  “Cell concentrations of 128 and 148 g per 1 dry cell weight (g 1-l {DCW}) were obtained using glucose or glycerol as carbon source, respectively.” (Korz et al., 1995, p. 59) 
                  This experiment shows that glycerol with a fed-batch technique had a greater dry-cell weight concentration than glucose.
                  When does acetic acid accumulate?
                  “Growth-inhibiting acidic by-products of incomplete substrate oxidation such as acetic acid are produced in response to oxygen limitation or excess carbon.” (Korz et al., 1995, p. 59) 
                  How does acetic acid accumulate in E. coli cultures? Acetic acid accumulation is cause by oxygen limitation or excess carbon.
                  What was the media composition?
                  (Korz et al., 1995, p. 60) Media composition in this experiment appears to be minimal because it does not contain any yeast extract.This is surprising because I would've expected that glucose outperforms glycerol only when provided a minimal media.
                  Figure of glucose dry-cell weight
                  (Korz et al., 1995, p. 62) (A) Time-course of {DCW} (g I-‘), mass flow of glucose into the bioreactor (g hh’) and glucose concentration fg I-‘) in the cell-free culture medium.
                  Figure of glycerol dry-cell weight
                  (Korz et al., 1995, p. 63) (A) Time-course of {DCW} (g l-l), mass flow of glycerol into the bioreactor (g h-l) and glycerol concentration (g 1-l) in the cell-free culture medium.
                  Reaching theoretical maximum yield
                  “Applying this simple feeding strategy, final biomass concentrations obtained using glucose and glycerol as carbon source correspond to 58\% and 67\%, respectively, of the maximum theoretical cell mass concentration with respect to the viscosity of the culture medium (the viscosity of the culture medium for E. coli increases steeply above 200 g 1-i {DCW} and the culture medium looses fluidity at around 220 g 1-l {DCW} (Mori et al., 1979)).” (Korz et al., 1995, p. 65) 
                  The authors were able to reach 58\% (glucose), and 67\% (glycerol) of the theoretical maximum yield of E. coli.

  abstract     = {Background: High concentrations of reactive oxygen species ({ROS}) were reported to cause oxidative stress to E. coli cells associated with reduced or inhibited growth. The high {ROS} concentrations described in these reports were generated by exposing the bacteria to H2O2 and superoxide-generating chemicals which are non-physiological growth conditions. However, the effect of molecular oxygen on oxidative stress response has not been evaluated. Since the use of oxygen-enriched air is a common strategy to support high density growth of E. coli, it was important to investigate the effect of high dissolved oxygen concentrations on the physiology and growth of E. coli and the way it responds to oxidative stress.
                  Results: To determine the effect of elevated oxygen concentrations on the growth characteristics, specific gene expression and enzyme activity in E. coli, the parental and {SOD}-deficient strain were evaluated when the dissolved oxygen ({dO}2) level was increased from 30\% to 300\%. No significant differences in the growth parameters were observed in the parental strain except for a temporary decrease of the respiration and acetate accumulation profile. By performing transcriptional analysis, it was determined that the parental strain responded to the oxidative stress by activating the {SoxRS} regulon. However, following the {dO}2 switch, the {SOD}-deficient strain activated both the {SoxRS} and {OxyR} regulons but it was unable to resume its initial growth rate.
                  Conclusion: The transcriptional analysis and enzyme activity results indicated that when E. coli is exposed to {dO}2 shift, the superoxide stress regulator {SoxRS} is activated and causes the stimulation of the superoxide dismutase system. This enables the E. coli to protect itself from the poisoning effects of oxygen. The {OxyR} protecting system was not activated, indicating that H2O2 did not increase to stressing levels.},

                  Human leptin is a 16-{kDa} (146-amino-acid) protein that is secreted from adipocytes and influences body weight homeostasis. In order to obtain high-level production of leptin, the human
                  obese
                  gene coding for leptin was expressed in
                  Escherichia coli
                  {BL}21({DE}3) under the strong inducible T7 promoter. The recombinant leptin was produced as inclusion bodies in
                  E. coli
                  , and the recombinant leptin content was as high as 54\% of the total protein content. For production of recombinant human leptin in large amounts, {pH}-stat fed-batch cultures were grown. Expression of leptin was induced at three different cell optical densities at 600 nm ({OD}
                  600
                  ), 30, 90, and 140. When cells were induced at an {OD}
                  600
                  of 90, the amount of leptin produced was 9.7 g/liter (37\% of the total protein). After simple purification steps consisting of inclusion body isolation, denaturation and refolding, and anion-exchange chromatography, 144.9 mg of leptin that was more than 90\% pure was obtained from a 50-ml culture, and the recovery yield was 41.1\%.},

Escherichia coli facilitates protein expression by its relative simplicity, its inexpensive and fast high-density cultivation, the well-known genetics and the large number of compatible tools available for biotechnology. Especially the variety of available plasmids, recombinant fusion partners and mutant strains have advanced the possibilities with E. coli. Although often simple for soluble proteins, major obstacles are encountered in the expression of many heterologous proteins and proteins lacking relevant interaction partners in the E. coli cytoplasm. Here we review the current most important strategies for recombinant expression in E. coli. Issues addressed include expression systems in general, selection of host strain, {mRNA} stability, codon bias, inclusion body formation and prevention, fusion protein technology and site-speciﬁc proteolysis, compartment directed secretion and ﬁnally co-overexpression technology. The macromolecular background for a variety of obstacles and genetic state-of-the-art solutions are presented.},
