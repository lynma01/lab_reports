# Abstract

The objectives of this two-part experiment were to analyze the growth of BL21(DE)-strain *E. coli* expressing the pET-28b-$\beta$-Gal plasmid in two vessel types: shake flasks and stirred tank bioreactors (STRs). For each vessel-experiment, the authors analyzed the effect of different growth conditions and preparation protocols informed by prior literature outlined in @tbl-exp-conditions.

The two vessels produced $\beta$-galactosidase-expressing *E. coli* cultures under different experimental conditions (e.g., aeration, media differences) for comparison and analysis. Growth rates were monitored by sampling and recording instrumentation measurements (e.g. pH, OD600 turbidity/OD600, dissolved oxygen) at different time-points. 

Results were analyzed to conclude whether the "optimal" incubation conditions for biomass accumulation from prior research (see: @sec-mm-sf) aligned with the results from both vessel-experiments as expected. These experiments will make a preliminary conclusion by measuring the turbidity/OD600 of the samples as a measure of biomass accumulation, while a definitive analysis on protein yield and activity will be reached in the second report: "Protein Production: Lab Report 2 - Bioprocessing".

# Introduction {#sec-bg}

Commercial production of recombinant proteins necessitates a comprehensive series of design decisions, each supported by scientific literature, to achieve efficient production yields. The design of the production system must simultaneously address several critical parameters:

- The protein-expressing host
- The incubation and/or production vessel
- The growth media
- The conditions within the vessel

Alterations or limitations in of these parameters requires reassessing the preceding design decisions to return to an optimized production process. Therefore, selecting the appropriate host, vessel, and growth media is of critical scientific importance. Other considerable factors such as nutrient availability, dissolved oxygen concentration (DO), and pH requirements, cost efficiency, scalability, and the risk of contamination by other organisms are essential. Nutrient availability, DO concentration, and pH are especially important with fast-growing cultures of bacteria because of the smaller window for successful intervention when parameters deviate from acceptable ranges.

## Hypothesis & Experimental Conditions {#sec-bg-exp-conditions}

These experiments use the BL21 *E. coli* strain, which, when combined with a pET-28 plasmid, provides an efficient organism for producing $\beta$-galactosidase, an enzyme which cleaves galactose and its analogs along its $\beta$-glycosidic bond. This enzyme will act as our reporter-protein for measuring the yield and activity of our different growth conditions in the following lab report: "Protein Production & Bioprocessing: Lab Report 2 - Bioprocessing". These current experiments will utilize turbidity/OD600 readings to infer the growth rates of the different experimental conditions and make a preliminary conclusion.

Our hypothesis is that of the conditions outlined in @tbl-exp-conditions, growth condition A1 and A2 will have the greatest biomass acumulation as measured in these experiments, and the greatest yield and active $\beta$-galactosidase in the follow-on report: "Protein Production: Lab Report 2 - Bioprocessing".

## Host Selection

Host selection is a critical determinant in recombinant protein production, influencing growth rate, scalability, metabolic capacity, and tolerance to environmental stressors. The following sections compare bacterial and mammalian systems, emphasizing the advantages of the BL21(DE3) strain of *E. coli* for its rapid growth, cost-efficiency, and robustness under shear and variable oxygen conditions.

### Bacterial vs. Mammalian Cells {#sec-bg-host-comp}

Bacterial systems are favored for recombinant protein production because they grow rapidly, are highly scalable, and cost efficient.[^hdc_ecoli] They can be cultured using batch or fed-batch strategies, though they lack the inherent ability for post-translational modifications without genetic engineering.[^leptin] Their short doubling time and effective use of antibiotics also help minimize contamination risks compared to mammalian cultures.

In contrast, mammalian cells naturally perform complex post-translational modifications, which is critical for producing many therapeutics. However, they grow more slowly, are costlier, and require more controlled environmental conditions. The longer culture times further increase contamination risks, necessitating stricter sterility protocols.[^lec_ls_growth]

### Host Fragility & Anchorage Dependence {#sec-bg-host-fragility}

Some final considerations depend on the shear-forces, and colony locations which host cells can best tolerate. For example, *E. coli* are free-floating organisms which can tolerate high shear-forces in culturing vessels, and are resilient to both too much *and* too little DO concentration.[^ec_ros] Animal cells, on the other hand, often require the presence of symbiotes to divide and are extremely susceptible to environmental factors like contamination or toxic byproducts:

![Comparison between microbes and animal cells and their optimal growth conditions. Extracted from (Shiloach, DiVito Lecture 9)[^lec_cell_growth].](images/ferm/microbes_vs_animal_cells.png){#fig-cell-comparison width="4in"}

These trade-offs and requirements become important as we consider the DO concentration vis-a-vis the fragility of the host, and where the host colonies are located within the vessel. Depending on the vessel type, DO is delivered and distributed either via: 

1. **Bioreactors**: forced air delivered through a "sparger" is then distributed throughout the vessel by the bioreactor impeller(s)'s mixing forces.

2. **Shake Flasks**: baffles inside the flask (which when rotated by the incubator platform) cause liquid to "splash", mix, and distribute air throughout.

The design-difficulty resides in the fact that greater distributions of DO requires greater shear-forces generated by the method of distribution. Unfortunately, even increasing the oxygen content of the forced air flow into the vessel doesn't equally, or efficiently increase the DO concentration of the vessel. This is such a ubiquitous problem that decades of fluid-dynamic research has been focused on optimizing impeller to deliver greater distribution while minimizing shear-force in the vessel as further described in @sec-bg-vessels.

### Experimental Host {#sec-bg-exp-host}


The BL21 strain of *E. coli* relies on the T7 promoter and lacUV5 promoter, with IPTG serving as the inducer to express $\beta$-galactosidase. These systems are highly efficient for producing enzymes like $\beta$-galactosidase and are optimized for conditions that ensure the delivery of essential nutrients and maintain a sterile environment.

As described in @sec-bg-exp-conditions, we expect that because growth conditions A1, and A2 have complex media, aeration, and IPTG induction, they will have the greatest yield of $\beta$-galactosidase. Because as described in @sec-bg-host-fragility, these bacteria are robust, free-floating, facultative anaerobes, and reproduce quickly, growth condition A1 & A2 are extremely conducive to *E. coli* growth.

## Vessel Selection

The choice of vessel has a significant impact on the efficiency and consistency of recombinant protein production:

### Shake Flasks vs. Bioreactors {#sec-bg-vessels}

Shake flasks are typically used during the early stages of the production process. They offer a cost-effective and straightforward means to test various culture conditions, including the supply of nutrients and the maintenance of a sterile environment.[^lec_ls_growth] However, shake flasks have limited control over parameters such as air and pH requirements, making them less ideal for large-scale production where precise regulation is critical.

Alternatively, stirred-tank bioreactors provide greater specific control over the culture environment: dissolved oxygen, temperature, and feed-rate of growth media (either batch or fed-batch) are crucial for maintaining optimal growth conditions. Bioreactors are especially versatile because of how the variety of impeller designs (@fig-impeller-types) allow for a greater number of production systems compared to shake flasks. This precise control enhances the overall yield and purity of the recombinant protein. The scalability offered by bioreactors makes them a preferred choice for commercial production processes, despite the higher initial cost.

![Different types of impellers described by the radial/axial flow and applicable organisms & substrates. From (Shiloach, Divito Lecture 4-5)[^lec_ls_growth]](images/ferm/impeller_types.png){#fig-impeller-types}

Finally, while there are limitations on the potential size of both types of vessels, bioreactors can reach sizes in excess of 1,400 liters[^lec_ls_growth], while shake flasks maximum volume is 500 milliliters. An additional caveat on shake flasks volume is that only 1/5th of the volume is reserved for the culture to prevent spillage in the incubator during shaking.

## Growth Media

The growth media used in the production process plays a fundamental role in supporting cell growth and protein expression. Media are formulated to provide the necessary nutrients that drive cellular metabolism and protein synthesis.

### Complex vs. Minimal Media {#sec-bg-media}

Complex media, such as Lysogeny Broth (LB) and its variants—LB Lennox, LB Lennox, and LB Miller—are nutrient-rich formulations that support rapid E. coli growth in bioreactor cultures. Although these media share a common base of tryptone and yeast extract, they differ primarily in salt content; for example, LB Lennox typically contains 5 g/L of NaCl, whereas LB Miller and traditional LB Lennox medium usually include around 10 g/L. These differences in ionic strength can influence cell osmolarity, growth kinetics, protein expression, and metabolic stress during large-scale cultivation.

Moreover, modified LB formulations used in experiments offer a range of nutrients and carbon sources that promote robust growth and high recombinant protein yields, although their variable composition lead to reproducibility challenges and thus increase production costs, particularly when excess nutrients lead to the formation of inhibitory byproducts.[^overcoming_acetate]

In contrast, minimal media provide a defined composition with only the essential nutrients—such as a specific carbon source, nitrogen source, and necessary salts—allowing for tighter control over cellular metabolism. Such defined conditions are especially useful when precise regulation of growth parameters or metabolic pathway studies is required, even though they typically result in slower growth rates and lower biomass yields compared to complex media.[^lec_media]

Ultimately, the choice between complex and minimal media depends on the specific experimental needs, including nutrient concentration, reproducibility, contamination risk, and overall cost, making this decision a critical factor in optimizing protein production processes. 

### Glycerol vs. Glucose {#sec-bg-carbon}
Glucose and glycerol are commonly used carbon sources in fermentation, but they influence cellular metabolism in distinct ways:

As a primary, easily metabolized substrate, glucose promotes rapid growth and energy production. However, its fast uptake can lead to overflow metabolism, where excess carbon is shunted to byproducts like acetate. This acetate accumulation can lower the pH and impose metabolic stress on E. coli, potentially hampering protein expression if the culture becomes too acidic.[^hdc_ecoli][^overcoming_acetate]

Glycerol is metabolized more slowly, which typically results in steadier growth and reduced risk of acetate build-up. Although it may not provide as much immediate energy as glucose, potentially leading to slightly lower biomass in some cases, it tends to support a more stable pH environment. This stability can be beneficial for reducing metabolic stress during recombinant protein production.

In conditions where no extra carbon is provided, growth relies solely on the nutrients inherent in the media. This may result in slower, more controlled cell proliferation and can serve as a baseline to assess the effects of adding a supplemental carbon source.

#### Expected Outcomes in the Experiments:

Glucose-Supplemented Conditions (e.g., A1, B1, E1, A2, C2): Expect a rapid increase in cell density with a potential early onset of acetate accumulation and a corresponding drop in pH during exponential growth.

Glycerol-Supplemented Conditions (e.g., G1, H1, B2): Anticipate a moderated growth rate with reduced acetate production, leading to improved pH stability. In non-inductive setups (such as H1), this may translate to higher overall biomass, although the immediate protein expression might be lower compared to glucose conditions.

No Supplemental Carbon (e.g., C1): Growth will be driven by the basal nutrients in the media, likely resulting in slower yet steadier kinetics, which provides a useful control for comparing the metabolic effects of glucose and glycerol.

This experimental design aims to balance the trade-offs between rapid growth and metabolic stress, helping to optimize fermentation conditions for recombinant protein production.

### Induction via IPTG {#sec-bg-iptg}

Isopropyl $\beta$-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) is a synthetic analog of lactose commonly used to induce the lac operon in *E. coli*. Under normal conditions, the *lac* operon is repressed by the lac repressor (*LacI*), which binds to the operator region and prevents transcription of downstream genes such as *lacZ*, encoding $\beta$-galactosidase. IPTG enters the bacterial cell and binds to *LacI*, causing a conformational change that releases the repressor from the operator. This de-repression allows RNA polymerase to access the promoter and initiate transcription of the *lac* operon genes. Unlike natural inducers (e.g., allolactose), IPTG is not metabolized by the cell, which results in a sustained induction of $\beta$-galactosidase production.

Introducing IPTG slightly before the exponential phase ensures that *E. coli* cells, emerging from the lag phase and actively upregulating their protein synthesis machinery, are optimally prepared for rapid $\beta$-galactosidase production. At this point, cells are poised for maximal metabolic activity—with abundant nutrients and energy fueling high transcription and translation rates—thereby maximizing yield. This timing also avoids the pitfalls of premature induction, which can overburden cells, or delayed induction, which may coincide with nutrient depletion and stress, while synchronizing protein production across the culture for consistent results in both shake flasks and bioreactors.

# Materials & Methods

## Media Preparation & Growth Parameters

*E. coli* BL21(DE3) cells transformed with the pET-28b-$\beta$-Gal plasmid were cultured under varying media formulations to evaluate how nutrient composition, carbon source, and aeration affect cell growth and enzyme production. All media were prepared under aseptic conditions; components were dissolved in distilled water and sterilized by autoclaving at 121°C for 15 minutes. Prior to inoculation, the pH of each medium was adjusted to 7.0 using sterile 1 M HCl or NaOH.

### Shake Flask Experiment {#sec-mm-sf}

For the shake flask experiment, the composition and preparation of the media and growth parameters were divided between three experimental variables: the growth media, carbon source, shake flask aeration via internal baffles, and induction via Isopropyl $\beta$-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG).

Modified Lysogeny - Lennox (LB) broth, a mixture of tryptone, yeast extract, sodium chloride, and dipotassium sulfate, is considered the most referenced carbon source for *E. coli* incubation. In certain experimental conditions, an extra carbon source (glucose/glycerol) was also added as an additional source of chemical energy for *E. coli* reproduction. 

|Vessel Type|Growth Condition|Growth Media|Carbon Source|Aeration|Induction|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Shake Flask|A1|Modified LB Media|Glucose|Aeration|IPTG|
|Shake Flask|B1|Modified LB Media|Glucose|No Aeration|IPTG|
|Shake Flask|C1|Modified LB Media|No Glucose|Aeration|IPTG|

: Shake Flask Growth Conditions {#tbl-sf-gc .striped}

In select experiments, glucose was added to provide an energy boost during the exponential phase, whereas in other conditions, glycerol was used to modulate metabolic fluxes and reduce the risk of acetate accumulation. To facilitate aeration, shake flasks were either equipped with internal baffles or left unmodified, thereby altering the oxygen transfer rates.

Agitation was maintained by an orbital shaker held at 37°C. Induction of $\beta$-galactosidase production was initiated by adding IPTG to a final concentration of 1 mM once adjusted OD600 readings reached 0.9, ensuring synchronization of protein expression with maximum metabolic activity. Growth was monitored by recording the optical density at 600 nm (OD600) and pH at regular time intervals, while periodic sampling allowed for the measurement of residual glucose levels.

### Bioreactor Experiment {#sec-br-gc}

For the bioreactor experiment, cultures were grown in a BioFlo/Celigen 115 benchtop bioreactor using two distinct media formulations: a complex medium supplemented with glucose along with essential nutrients (K₂HPO₄, MgSO₄, and trace metals) and a minimal medium with a defined carbon source. 

The complex LB media outlined in @tbl-br-gc was designed to promote robust growth by providing both a variety of nutrients and vitamins as well as ample buffering capacity to stabilize pH fluctuations caused by metabolic byproducts. Whereas the minimal medium was designed for tighter regulation of growth parameters and reduced variability by removing difficult to reproduce ingredients like Tryptone and Yeast Extract at the expense of excess nutrients.

In the bioreactor, temperature was held constant at 37°C, and dissolved oxygen (DO) was maintained above 10% (mmol O2/reactor volume) by regularly increasing agitation and air sparging, ensuring a homogeneous environment conducive to high-density cell growth. IPTG was added once OD600 readings reached 0.9 to induce $\beta$-galactosidase synthesis, and continuous monitoring of OD600, pH, and DO allowed for real-time assessment of the fermentation process.

|Bioreactor|A2|Complex Media|Glucose|K2HPO4 + MgSO4 + trace metals|IPTG|
|Bioreactor|B2|Complex Media|Glycerol|K2HPO4 + MgSO4 + trace metals|IPTG|
|Bioreactor|C2|Minimal Media|Glucose|trace metals|IPTG|

## Culture Monitoring & Harvesting
In shake flask experiments, periodic OD600, pH, and glucose measurements identified exponential growth, while bioreactor experiments used continuous monitoring of pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and agitation—supplemented by OD600 sampling—to assess cell density and oxygen use.

### Monitoring
In the shake flask experiments, the cultures were monitored by taking hourly samples of 1mL aliquots. Samples' analysis included optical density (OD600) to gauge turbidity and thus cell density, along with periodic pH readings to track changes in the medium’s acidity. Additionally, residual glucose levels were measured over time to provide insight into the metabolic activity of the cells—especially useful for identifying when the culture entered the exponential phase and began to deplete its primary carbon source.

In the bioreactor experiment, pH, temperature, DO, agitation (RPM), were continuously recorded by the bioreactor’s built-in sensors, providing real-time data. pH was also tracked continuously using a secondary meter to ensure accuracy, as were glucose levels. Agitation was controlled and recorded via RPM readings, which helped understand the slowly increasing rate of DO consumption by the *E. coli* culture. Finally, Turbidity (OD600) was measured by sampling 1mL aliquots of the culture over six time-points before analysis in a photospectrometer.

### Cell Harvesting

At after six hours, both cultures were harvested by centrifugation, and its fractions stored at -4 Celsius. Cells from both these experiments will be further analyzed in the next report: "Protein Production: Lab Report 2 - Bioprocessing", where $\beta$-galactosidase yield and activity will be quantified after purification protocols are completed. The results will then be correlated to OD600 readings and nutrient depletion profiles (e.g., glucose or glycerol concentration).

# Discussion & Conclusion
This study investigated the influence of various growth conditions on recombinant protein production by E. coli BL21(DE3) using both shake flask and bioreactor systems.

In the shake flasks experiment, the comparative analysis of different media and carbon sources revealed that the absence of induction in Growth Condition H1 supported higher biomass accumulation, while the unique pH trends observed in Conditions C1 and A1 underscored the critical role of carbon source and growth media selection modulate a culture's pH. 

In the bioreactor experiment, enhanced control over agitation and aeration, coupled with strategic nutrient supplementation, resulted in stable and high-density cultures, underscoring the importance of process control in scaling up protein production. 

Collectively, these findings provide a robust framework for optimizing fermentation conditions in industrial biotechnology applications, balancing the trade-offs between cell growth and recombinant protein expression.

## Shake Flask

### Comparing Growth Rates by Carbon Source

In the shake flask experiments, Growth Condition H1 exhibited significantly higher turbidity (OD600) compared to Growth Condition A1. *Prima facie*, this suggests that the absence of IPTG induction and using glycerol as a carbon source alleviated the metabolic burden of acetate accumulation typically associated with protein synthesis. However, this analysis is complicated for several reasons:

(Eiteman, Altman 2006, p. 531) suggests that glycerol is actually a superior carbon source to glucose in support of the above reasoning, writing: "...recent results have demonstrated glycerol is superior to glucose for reduced acetate and increased recombinant protein formation when supplied post-induction.”[^overcoming_acetate] However, this is not a cohesive explanation because growth condition H1 was not induced with IPTG. Likewise, if we compare the two minimal media growth conditions E1, and G1 which only differed in their usage of glucose and glycerol respectively, we can see from @fig-sf-od-comp that the glucose treatment outperformed the glycerol treatment.

This lends two potential explanations:

First, given that both conditions growth rates were almost equally high, perhaps condition A1 was limited by the combined metabolic stress of growth-related acetate accumulation[^hdc_ecoli] and $\beta$-galactosidase synthesis, whereas condition H1 only faced growth-related acetate accumulation. We can see that from @fig-sf-carbon-comp, that condition A1's glucose concentration was almost completely depleted during the same period. 

These data points imply that the rapid depletion of glucose likely triggered a metabolic shift in the *E. coli* culture, resulting in an overflow metabolism that produced acetate as a byproduct. This is corroborated by (Eiteman, Altman 2006)[^overcoming_acetate] in @fig-pop-acetate. However, this explanation is also complicated in that the increasing levels of acetate in A1 should decrease the pH levels, not increase them as seen in @fig-sf-ph-comp. Potential explanations for this phenomena will be explored in @sec-dc-sf-ph.

The second explanation is that because glycerol is less-efficiently converted in chemical energy[^overcoming_acetate], condition H1's *E. coli* colonies promoted biomass accumulation, as opposed to $\beta$-galactosidase expression. Thus, H1's turbidity readings would be much greater in this experiment with less yield of active protein measured in the following report.

However, without the protein yield and activity analysis to be included in the following report, this claim is inconclusive. What we can conclude is that there's a slight advantage in biomass accumulation when using glycerol to mitigate the metabolic stress created by the increased growth rates from using LB media. 

### Growth Condition C1 Increasing in pH Over Time

Growth Condition C1 displayed a gradual increase in pH over the duration of the experiment, a trend that contrasts with the typical acidification observed during microbial fermentation. This shift may be attributed to the absence of supplemental glucose, which usually leads to the production of acidic byproducts through glycolysis, thus lowering the pH.

A potential explanation is that without glucose as a primary carbon source, the cells likely redirected their metabolic pathways toward alternative substrates, resulting in less acid generation, the consumption of acidic compounds in the media, and/or the production of alkaline byproducts. The rising pH in C1 underscores the profound influence that carbon source composition exerts on metabolic flux and highlights the need for tailored media formulations to maintain optimal pH conditions for enzymatic activity and cell viability.

### Growth Condition A1’s pH Falling then Climbing {#sec-dc-sf-ph}

For Growth Condition A1, the pH exhibited a biphasic response as seen in @fig-sf-ph-comp: an initial decline during the early exponential phase followed by a recovery at later stages. The initial drop in pH is consistent with rapid glycolytic activity and the concomitant accumulation of organic acids, particularly when using glucose-rich modified LB media. However, the pH rebounds at time-point 4 -> 5.

![Estimate of acetate formation once *E. coli* population has reached the "plateau" growth-phase. Taken from (Eiteman, Altman 2006)[^overcoming_acetate]](images/ferm/ovc_ae_fig_01.png){#fig-pop-acetate width=4in}

A potential explanation for the rise in pH is that: as the culture matured, buffering capacity inherent in the media and/or the consumption of acidic metabolites once the added glucose was depleted. This changing pH profile reflects the complex interactions between cellular metabolism, nutrient availability, and media buffering, emphasizing the importance of continuous pH monitoring and control in fermentation processes to ensure a conducive environment for protein production.

## Bioreactor

In contrast to the shake flask system, bioreactor experiments provided enhanced control over critical parameters such as agitation, aeration, and pH. The bioreactor’s precise modulation of dissolved oxygen through controlled RPM and air sparging ensured a homogeneous culture environment, which is essential for maintaining consistent growth kinetics and protein expression. Moreover, the supplementation of complex media with nutrients like K₂HPO₄, MgSO₄, and trace metals helped stabilize pH fluctuations, thereby reducing metabolic stress on the cells. These controlled conditions facilitated high-density growth and efficient recombinant protein production, demonstrating the scalability and reproducibility advantages of bioreactor systems over shake flasks.

### pH Sensor Discrepancy

The discrepancy between the two measurement systems evinced in @fig-bt-ph suggests potential calibration issues, sensor drift, or differential sampling locations within the vessel.

# Summary

## Objectives:
The experiments aimed to evaluate the growth and protein production of E. coli BL21(DE3) expressing the pET-28b-β-Gal plasmid under varying conditions. Specifically, the study compared shake flask and bioreactor systems to determine how different media formulations, carbon sources, and induction protocols affect cell growth, metabolic activity, and ultimately recombinant protein yield.

## Materials:
- Biological System: E. coli BL21(DE3) with pET-28b-β-Gal plasmid.
- Media: Complex (modified LB) and minimal media with variations in carbon sources (glucose or glycerol).

- Equipment:
  - Shake flasks (with or without internal baffles for aeration).
  - A benchtop BioFlo/Celigen 115 bioreactor with integrated sensors for pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), and agitation.

## Methods:
- Shake Flask Experiments:
  - Cultures were grown under different conditions (e.g., variations in carbon source and aeration).
  - Hourly samples were collected to measure optical density (OD600) for cell density, pH for acidity changes, and residual glucose for metabolic activity.
  - IPTG was added at an OD600 of 0.9 to induce protein expression in select conditions.
- Bioreactor Experiments:
  - Cultures were maintained at 37°C in a controlled environment.
  - Continuous monitoring of key parameters (pH, temperature, DO, agitation) was implemented via built-in sensors, with periodic OD600 sampling.
  - The system ensured a homogeneous environment through regulated aeration and agitation.
  - Both systems concluded with cell harvesting by centrifugation after six hours for further analysis of protein yield and activity.

## Major Findings:
- Shake Flask Results:
  - Different growth conditions resulted in variable biomass accumulation and pH profiles. For instance, a condition without IPTG induction and using glycerol (H1) exhibited higher turbidity, suggesting enhanced cell growth possibly due to reduced metabolic stress.
  - pH trends varied: one condition showed a rising pH likely due to the absence of glucose-induced acid production, while another displayed a biphasic pH response (initial drop followed by recovery), reflecting dynamic metabolic shifts and buffering effects.
- Bioreactor Results:
  - The controlled bioreactor environment facilitated stable, high-density growth with real-time monitoring of crucial parameters.
  - Enhanced control over aeration and agitation led to consistent conditions that are advantageous for scaling up protein production.

Overall, the experiments provided insights into optimizing fermentation conditions by balancing nutrient composition, aeration, and induction strategies to maximize cell growth and recombinant protein production.
